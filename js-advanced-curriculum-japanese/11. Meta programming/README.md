# **Introduction**

Meta programming is a programming technique in which a computer programs have the ability to treat other programs
as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and
even modify itself while running. In some cases, this allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code
to express a solution, in turn reducing development time.

In `ES6`, JavaScript gains support for the `Proxy` and `Reflect` objects allowing us to intercept and define
custom behavior for fundamental language operations. With the help of these two objects, we are able to program
at the meta level of JavaScript.

This module is more of a bonus module, and will not teach you these concepts **deeply**, but aims to introduce you
to them.
