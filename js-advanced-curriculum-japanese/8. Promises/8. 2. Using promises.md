# **Using promises**

We created a promise and stored it in the `promise const`. How can we access the value passed by the `resolve` or `reject` functions?

All `Promise` instances have a `.then()` method on them:

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (Math.random() * 100 <= 90) {
    resolve("I am resolved!");
  }

  reject(new Error("10% of the times, I will fail"));
});

promise.then(
  response => {
    console.log(response);
  },
  error => {
    console.log(error);
  }
);

// The expected output will depend on the value generated by the Math.random()
// It will either be:
// I am resolved
// 10% of the times, I will fail
```

`.then()` accepts two callbacks. The first callback is invoked when the promise is resolved. The second is 
executed when the promise is rejected.

If a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback (i.e a `then`), the correct
callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier. That means once the promise reaches a final state,
the state won't change (the computation will not be done again).

A promise is evaluated eagerly. It starts its execution as soon as you declare and bind it to a variable.
