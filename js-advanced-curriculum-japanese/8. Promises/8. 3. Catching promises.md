# **Catching promises**

We only saw the `resolve` cases so far, what happens when an error occurs in the executor function?
When an error occurs, the second callback of `.then()` is executed:

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (Math.random() * 100 <= 90) {
    reject(new Error("I was rejected using the reject function"));
  }

  reject(new Error("10% of the times, I will fail"));
});

promise.then(
  () => console.log(resolved),
  error => console.log(error.message)
);

// expected output: I was rejected using the reject function
```

This is a similar example of the last section, however now 90% of the time we will reject, and throw an error in
the other 10% of cases.

However, instead of writing `.then(null, () => { ... })` when we want to handle an error, we can use the `.catch()`
which accepts one callback: `onRejected`.

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (Math.random() * 100 <= 90) {
    reject(new Error("I was rejected using the reject function"));
  }

  reject(new Error("10% of the times, I will fail"));
});

promise.catch(error => console.log(error.message)); // expected output: I was rejected using the reject function
```

`.catch()` is just syntactical sugar fro `.then(undefined, onRejected)`.
