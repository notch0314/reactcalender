# **`this`** keyword
The `this` variable is a variable that every execution context gets, and as we already know, it is stored in the 
execution context object. 

In a **regular function call**, the `this` keyword points at the global object.  
In a **method call**, the `this` keyword points to the object that is calling the method.

The `this` keyword is not assigned a value until a function where it is defined is actually called.
