# **Hoisting**

Conceptually, for example, a strict definition of hoisting suggests that variables and function declarations are
physically moved to the top of your code, but this is not what happens. Instead, the variable and function declarations
are put into memory during the creation phase, but stay exactly where you typed them in your code.

All declarations (`function`, `var`, `let`, `const` and `class`) are hoisted in JavaScript, while `var` declarations
are initialized with `undefined`, `let` and `const` declarations remain uninitialized. They will only get initialized
when their lexical bindings (assignment) is evaluated during runtime by the JavaScript Engine.

## **Example**

```js
greet("John");

function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`); // expected output: "Hello John"
}
```

Even though we call the function in our code first, before the function is written, the code still works. This is
because of how context execution works in JavaScript.

## **Only declarations are hoisted**

JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations. If a variable is declared and initialized after using it,
the value will be `undefined`

```js
console.log(name); // expected output: undefined
var name;
name = "John";
```

```js
name = "John";
console.log(name); // expected output: John
var name;
```
