# **Execution Context in Detail**
Like previously explained, we can associate an execution context with an object.
This object has three properties:  
- `Variable Object` (VO)  
  Which will contain function arguments inner variable declarations as well as function declarations;
- `Scope Chain` 
  Which will contain the current variable objects as well as the variable objects of all its parents
- `this` variable  
  
When a function is called, a new `execution context` is created and put on top of the `execution stack` and this happens
in two phases:

1. Creation phase
2. Execution phase

In the creation phase, we first have the creation of the `Variable Object`, then the creation of the `Scope Chain`
and lastly the `this` variable is determined and set. 

Then, in the execution phase, the code and the function that generated the current execution context is run line by line
and all the variables are defined.

### **The `Variable Object`**

- The argument object is created, containing all the arguments that were passed into a function.
- The code is scanned for `function declarations`: for each function, a property is created in the `Variable Object`  
  **pointing to the function**
- The code is scanned for `variable declarations`: for each variable, a property is created in the `Variable Object`  
  and set to `undefined`

These last two points is what we commonly call `hoisting`. Functions and variables are hoisted in JavaScript, which means
that they are available before the execution phase actually starts. The difference between functions and variables is that functions are already defined
before the execution phase starts, while variables are set up to be `undefined` and will only be defined in the execution phase.
