# **How Our Code is Executed: JS Engines and Parsers**

In this first lesson of this topic we will see how JavaScript code is actually executed.

## **What happens to our code?**

JavaScript is always hosted in some environment, typically the browser, but it can also be in a Node.js application
or other kind of application that accepts JavaScript code input, however, for this course, we will only focus on the
browser.

When we write our JavaScript code, the place where JavaScript is hosted, has some kind of JavaScript Engine that
takes our code and executes it. As a simple explanation, imagine that the JavaScript Engine is a program which
executes JavaScript code, and there are a lot of different engines, for example, Google's V8 Engine, which is used
by Google Chrome.

The first thing that happens inside the engine, is that our code is `parsed` by a parser, which basically reads our
code line by line, and check if the syntax of the code given is correct. This means that the parser knows the rules
of JavaScript and how it has to be written in order to be considered valid. And if there are any mistakes, it throws
an error and stops the execution, otherwise, the parser produces a `data structure` known as the **Abstract Syntax Tree**
that is translated into machine code. This means that this code is no longer JavaScript code but a set of instructions
which are able to be executed directly by the computer's processor.
