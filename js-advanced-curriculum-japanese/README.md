# **JavaScript Advanced Curriculum**

This curriculum is an attempt to give you an in-depth understanding of JavaScript, but the purpose of itself is not to act
as a documentation. It will teach you some of the most used parts, modern parts, of JavaScript, however it will not teach
you 100% of the language's features.

For more information on a specific feature, or a not covered feature, we recommend that you read the documentation.

- How JavaScript works behind the scenes
