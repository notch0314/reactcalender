# **Mixins**

Abstract superclasses (or mixins) are templates for classes. Classes can only have a single superclass, which makes multiple
inheritance from tooling classes not possible. The functionality must be provided by the superclass.

A mixin provides methods that implement a certain behavior, but we do not use it alone, we use it to add the behavior to
other classes.

The simplest way to implement a mixin in JavaScript is to make an object with useful methods, and merge them into a prototype
of any class

```js
const sayHiMixin = {
  sayHi(person) {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Hi, ${person}!`);
  }
};

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    Object.assign(Person.prototype, sayHiMixin);
  }
}

const john = new Person("John");
john.sayHi("Jack"); // expected output: John says: Hi Jack!
```

We can also do it on a different way by using `class expressions` to create a new base class for every mixin:

```js
const SayHiMixin = superclass =>
  class extends superclass {
    sayHi(person) {
      console.log(`${this.name} says: Hi, ${person}!`);
    }
  };

class Human {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Person extends SayHiMixin(Human) {}

const jack = new Person("Jack");
jack.sayHi("John"); // expected output: Jack says: Hi, John!
```
