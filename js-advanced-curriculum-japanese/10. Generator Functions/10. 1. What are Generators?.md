# **What are Generators?**

Let's see this function:

```js
function fn() {
  console.log("I");
  console.log("Am");
  console.log("Unstoppable");
}
```

The only way to exit this function, is by `returning` from it. or `throwing` an error. If you call this function
again, it will begin the execution from the top.

A generator is a function that **can stop midway** and then continue from where it stopped.

In JavaScript, a generator is a function which returns an object which you can call `next()`. Every invocation of `next()`
will return an object of the following shape:

```ts
{
  value: any,
  done: boolean
}
```

The `value` property will contain the value, where the `done` property is either `true` or `false`. When the `done` property
becomes `true`, the generator stops and won't generate any more values.
