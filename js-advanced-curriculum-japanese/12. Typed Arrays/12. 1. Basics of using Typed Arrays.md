# **Basics of using Typed Arrays**

To use Typed Arrays, we need to create an `ArrayBuffer` and a view to it. The easiest way is to create a
typed array view of the desired size and type.

```js
let f64a = new Float64Array(8);
f64a[0] = 10;
f64a[1] = 20;
f64a[2] = f64a[0] + f64a[1];
```

### **Data Views**

To use `ArrayBuffers` that contain data with heterogenous types, the easiest way is to use a `DataView` to the buffer.
Suppose we have a file format that has a header with an `8-bit` unsigned int followed by two `16-bit int`, followed by
a payload array of `32-bit float`. Reading this with a `DataView` is easy, we read the header and use a typed array for
the float array:

```js
const dv = new DataView(buffer);
const vector_length = dv.getUint8(0);
const width = dv.getUint16(1); // 0 + UInt8 = 1 bytes offset
const height = dv.getUint16(3); // 0 + UInt8 + UInt16 = 3 bytes offset
const vectors = new Float32Array(width * height * vector_length);

for (let i = 0, off = 5; i < vectors.length; i++, off += 4) {
  vectors[i] = dv.getFloat32(off);
}
```
